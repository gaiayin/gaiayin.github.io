        <p>My name is Rachel — I’m a Yin Yoga teacher, newly qualified in June 2025. I’ve been practising yin yoga for 5 years and it has helped me to recover from chronic illness.</p>

        <p>Practising yin yoga has helped me to take time for myself to calm my nervous system and rebalance. I am an active person who enjoys walking, cycling, running, swimming, hatha/vinyasa yoga and pilates. I used to be on the go all of the time and found it difficult to switch off when it was time to sleep.</p>

        <p>I have learnt to balance activities with periods of rest and recovery. Yin yoga forms part of my daily practice alongside meditation and breathwork.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h3 id="about-yin-heading">About Yin Yoga</h3>

        <p>Yin yoga is a meditative, slow-paced style of yoga that focuses on holding postures for several minutes to target the body’s deep connective tissues, most notably fascia.</p>

        <h4>Finding Your Edge in Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>During yin yoga, yogis find their “edge”, the point in a pose where a significant stretch is felt without any sharp pain. This is the ideal spot to hold a posture for an extended period, typically three to five minutes, allowing the body to relax into the stretch.
        </p>

          </figure>
        </div>

        <h4>The Physical and Energetic Benefits of Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>Unlike dynamic exercises that focus on muscular engagement, yin yoga applies gentle, sustained stress to the body’s deep connective tissues, particularly fascia. This process helps improve flexibility and increase joint mobility.
        </p>
        <p>By targeting the fascia, yin yoga serves as a powerful complement to more active workouts. It nurtures the body’s deep structural network, helping to balance the intensity of other exercises. This not only prevents stiffness and injury but also benefits the fascia’s role as a vital communication channel, promoting overall health and wellbeing.
        </p>

        <h4>Energy and Charge in the Body</h4>
        <p>Fascia is a web of fibrous connective tissue that surrounds every muscle, bone, organ, and nerve in your body. It not only provides structural support but also plays a crucial role in communication.
        </p>       
        <p>Recent research suggests that fascia acts as a high-speed information highway, transmitting electrical signals and cellular messages throughout the body. By applying gentle pressure and stretching through yin yoga, you can release fascial tension and optimise this communication network, which may improve cellular function and promote overall well-being.
        </p>

        <h4>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>The principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offer a powerful lens through which to understand the benefits of yin yoga. In TCM, the body’s vital energy, or Qi, is believed to flow through channels called meridians. Fascia, with its web-like structure and electrical properties, is thought to be the physical medium for these meridians. The long-held poses in yin yoga are designed to stimulate these specific meridian lines, which are linked to various organs. By nourishing the fascial network, yin yoga can help to unblock stagnant Qi, restore its proper flow, and bring the body’s systems into balance, reflecting the holistic healing philosophy of TCM.
        </p>

        <h4>Living in Harmony with our Natural Energy Cycles</h4>
        <p>This holistic approach to bodily harmony also extends to our natural biological cycles, including ultradian rhythms. These are the roughly 90-120 minute cycles of activity and rest that our bodies undergo throughout the day. When we push through the natural “ultradian trough,” or dip in energy and focus, we disrupt this essential rhythm, leading to stress, fatigue, and diminished performance. 
        </p>    
        <p> Yin yoga provides a powerful tool for honouring these cycles. By taking a break from a highly active or “yang” state to engage in a slow, meditative yin practice, you are consciously stepping into the restorative phase of an ultradian cycle. The long holds and quiet nature of yin yoga allow your body to naturally activate the parasympathetic nervous system—the “rest and digest” response—which is crucial for cellular repair, detoxification, and energy replenishment. This not only helps you restore your energy in the short term but also trains your body to recognise and respond to its natural signals, promoting a more balanced and sustainable sense of wellbeing over time.
        </p>

        <h4>The Difference between Yin and Restorative Yoga</h4>
        <p>It’s important to note the difference between yin yoga and restorative yoga. While both are slow and use props, restorative yoga is focused on complete relaxation and uses props to fully support the body so you can rest without any stretching. 
        </p>
        <p>Yin yoga, on the other hand, uses props to help you find your “edge” and apply a gentle, sustained stress to your connective tissues.
