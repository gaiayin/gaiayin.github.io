        <p>My name is Rachel — I’m a Yin Yoga teacher, newly qualified in June 2025. I’ve been practising yin yoga for 5 years and it has helped me to recover from chronic illness.</p>

        <p>Practising yin yoga has helped me to take time for myself to calm my nervous system and rebalance. I am an active person who enjoys walking, cycling, running, swimming, hatha/vinyasa yoga and pilates. I used to be on the go all of the time and found it difficult to switch off when it was time to sleep.</p>

        <p>I have learnt to balance activities with periods of rest and recovery. Yin yoga forms part of my daily practice alongside meditation and breathwork.</p>

    <!-- ABOUT YIN YOGA (DETAILED) -->

      <div class="container">
        <h3 id="about-yin-heading">About Yin Yoga</h3>

        <p>Yin yoga is a meditative, slow-paced style of yoga that focuses on holding postures for several minutes to target the body’s deep connective tissues, most notably fascia.</p>

        <h4>Finding Your Edge in Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>During yin yoga, yogis find their “edge”, the point in a pose where a significant stretch is felt without any sharp pain. This is the ideal spot to hold a posture for an extended period, typically three to five minutes, allowing the body to relax into the stretch.</p>

        </div>

        <h4>The Physical and Energetic Benefits of Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>Unlike dynamic exercises that focus on muscular engagement, yin yoga applies gentle, sustained stress to the body’s deep connective tissues, particularly fascia. This process helps improve flexibility and increase joint mobility. By targeting the fascia, yin yoga serves as a powerful complement to more active workouts. It nurtures the body’s deep structural network, helping to balance the intensity of other exercises and preventing stiffness and injury.</p>

        <h4>Energy and Charge in the Body</h4>
        <p>Fascia is a web of fibrous connective tissue that surrounds every muscle, bone, organ, and nerve in your body. It not only provides structural support but also plays a crucial role in communication. Recent research suggests that fascia acts as an information highway, transmitting electrical signals and cellular messages. By applying gentle pressure and stretching through yin yoga, you can release fascial tension and optimise this communication network, which may improve cellular function and promote overall wellbeing.</p>

        <h4>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Yin Yoga</h4>
        <p>The principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offer a powerful lens through which to understand the benefits of yin yoga. In TCM, the body’s vital energy, or Qi, flows through channels called meridians. Fascia, with its web-like structure and electrical properties, is thought to be the physical medium for these meridians. Long-held yin postures are designed to stimulate specific meridian lines linked to organs. By nourishing the fascial network, yin yoga can help to unblock stagnant Qi, restore its proper flow, and bring the body’s systems into balance.</p>

        <h4>Living in Harmony with our Natural Energy Cycles</h4>
        <p>Yin yoga supports natural biological cycles, including ultradian rhythms — roughly 90–120 minute cycles of activity and rest. When we push through the natural energy dips we disrupt these rhythms, leading to stress and fatigue. Yin helps honour these cycles by encouraging a restorative state, activating the parasympathetic nervous system and supporting cellular repair and energy replenishment.</p>

        <h4>The Difference between Yin and Restorative Yoga</h4>
        <p>Restorative yoga focuses on complete relaxation and uses props to fully support the body so you can rest without stretching. Yin yoga uses props to help you find your “edge” and apply a gentle, sustained stress to connective tissues.</p>
